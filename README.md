# CS231n-2017

[CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2017/) was a very well-paced introductory course for experienced coders.

I completed all assignments, except PyTorch notebooks and one extra credit. Also, I have tried to ensure all solution codes are cleanly written and efficient, so others who self-study may find them helpful.

I have not included various boilerplate code provided by the course. You may find them here:
* [assignment 1](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/assignments/2017/spring1617_assignment1.zip)
* [assignment 2](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/assignments/2017/spring1617_assignment2.zip)
* [assignment 3](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/assignments/2017/spring1617_assignment3.zip)
