# CS231n-2017

[CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2017/) was a very well-paced introductory course for experienced coders.
I have tried to ensure all solutions are cleanly written and efficient, so others who self-study may find them helpful.

I have not included various boilerplate code provided by the course. You may find them here:
